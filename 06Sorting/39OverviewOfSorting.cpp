// 1->Binary Array -> partition QuickSort (Lomuto and Hoare,Naive)

// 2-> ARRAY OF SIZE N AND SMALL ranged values 
// it means n=500 but elements are of between 100 to 200
// In this case we use counting sort
// time O(n)and space O(k)

// 3-> Array of size n and ranger is of size n^2 or n^3 or closer
// In this case we use Radix Sort bcz couting sort will not work here
// Time complexity O(n) and Space O(n) 

// 4->Array of uniformly distributed data over a range
// In this case we use Bucket sort

// 5->Whered memory writes are costly 
// In this case we use Selection sort and Cycle Sort

// 6-> When adjacent swaps are allowed
// In this case we use BubbleSort and Cocktail sort

// 7-> When array size is small 
// Insertion sort

// When available extra memory is less
// Shall Sort
