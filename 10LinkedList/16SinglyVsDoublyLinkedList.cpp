// a given delete a node in O(1) time with given
// reference /pointer to it

// Insert/Delete before a given node

// Insert/Delete from the both ends in O(1) by maintaining
// tail


// *****************************************
// Disadvantages:

// extra space for prev
// code becomes more complex
